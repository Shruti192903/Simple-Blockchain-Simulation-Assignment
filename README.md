# Simple Blockchain Simulation

## Overview

This project simulates a basic blockchain with core features like block creation, proof-of-work, and chain validation. It demonstrates how a blockchain works by allowing users to add data records, mine blocks, and validate the integrity of the chain.

## Features

- **Block Structure**: Each block contains an entry ID, previous identifier, data records, timestamp, and iteration counter.
- **Proof-of-Work**: A basic proof-of-work mechanism is implemented to make block creation computationally intensive.
- **Chain Validation**: The blockchain's integrity is validated by checking hashes and previous identifiers.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for this project.
- **Hashlib**: Used for generating SHA-256 hashes.
- **JSON**: Used for encoding block data into JSON strings.

## Setup and Execution

1. **Clone the Repository**:
  [Git Clone]([https://example.com](https://github.com/your-username/simple-blockchain-simulation.git))



3. **Run the Simulation**:
python blockchain_simulation.py


4. **Interact with the Blockchain**:
  - Add data records and mine blocks.
  - Validate the chain's integrity.
  - Simulate tampering with the blockchain.

## Project Structure

- **blockchain_simulation.py**: Contains the core blockchain logic.
- **README.md**: This file provides setup and execution instructions.
